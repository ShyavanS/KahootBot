# KahootBot
A Kahoot Spamming Bot Employing Multithreading

A twist on the standard Kahoot spambot. Uses selenium to do webscraping and answers the Kahoot, but you can also set the number of bots you want to flood the game and a username for all of them with a number identifier. The flood of bots is accomplished by incorporating threading and generating each bot as its own thread. The more your processor is better at multithreaded workloads, the more you can spam!

Note: This is a learning tool. I don't actually condone spamming Kahoots. It ruins the fun for everyone and also annoys teachers who are working hard to help you learn. I have not and would never use this on any of my teachers, I just made it for myself for fun.
